# Commitment to Systematic Debugging and Improvement

I swear that throughout the process of fixing the Tamarin protocol syntax highlighting, I will:

1. **Continuously update hypotheses**:
   - Keep track of all hypotheses in `hypotheses.md`
   - Update hypothesis status as evidence emerges
   - Add new hypotheses based on findings
   - Be willing to change course when evidence contradicts hypotheses

2. **Regularly perform web searches**:
   - Search for Neovim TreeSitter documentation and examples
   - Look for specific error messages to find solutions
   - Research TreeSitter regex limitations
   - Find examples of working query files from other languages

3. **Follow systematic testing procedures**:
   - Make incremental, focused changes
   - Test each change individually
   - Document all test results
   - Use git to track all changes

4. **Maintain diagnostics and logs**:
   - Keep detailed logs of all tests
   - Track configuration state in each test
   - Capture all error messages
   - Analyze patterns in failures

5. **Document findings clearly**:
   - Update documentation after fixes
   - Create clear explanations of issues found
   - Document any limitations discovered
   - Provide guidance for future maintenance

This approach aligns with the principles in `radical_new_approach.md` and represents a genuine commitment to solving the issues in a systematic, evidence-based manner rather than through guesswork or ad-hoc fixes.
