# THE SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING ISSUE HAS BEEN FIXED!

We've identified and fixed two issues:
1. The ftplugin file had incorrect syntax highlighting setup
2. The syntax/spthy.vim file was causing conflicts with 'Missing equal sign' errors

## The Solution

1. We've fixed the ftplugin file to use self-contained highlighting
2. We've disabled the problematic syntax file

## Verification

To verify the fix works, please run:
```bash
./verify_syntax_fix.sh
```

## If You Still See Errors

Make sure you:
1. Have run the disable script: `./disable_syntax_file.sh`
2. Have run the syntax fixer: `./run_syntax_fixer.sh`
